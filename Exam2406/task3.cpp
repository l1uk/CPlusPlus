// 3. 	Abstract classes and polymorphism   		20 points
//
// 3.1  Extend the below given class Property by adding the correct data members given in the constructor.
//      Only derived classes should be able to change these data members. The program should then run error-free.
//
// 3.2  Modify the class Property so that it will be an abstract class [by using the member function print()].
//
// 3.3  What is special about abstract base classes?
//	Name at least 3 features.				
//      ANSWER:
//      -  Abstract classes cannot instantiate objects
//      -  Derived classes inherits pure virtual functions, so if they are not explicitly re-defined the derived class is still abstract
//      -  Pointer of abstract class type can be created (that point to a derived non-abstract object)
//
// 3.4  Extend the program by adding a derived class House of the abstract class Property.
//      This derived class should have the data member floors, which is of the data type int,
//      and furnished, which is of the data type bool, implemented.
//      Itâ€™s also supposed to have a default constructor and a constructor member initializer list.
//      Which member function(s) have to be implemented to run the program? Implement this member function(s).
// the function print() needs to be implemented
